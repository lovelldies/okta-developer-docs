## Events

After Okta initiates the outbound logout request to <StackSnippet snippet="downup" inline />, Okta includes the number of OIDC and SAML app logouts that occurred with SLO. Those numbers are found in the System Log event `user.session.end` under `DebugData`:

* `TotalOidcLogoutRequests`: Lists the total number of logout requests for OIDC apps
* `TotalSamlLogoutRequests`: Lists the total number of logout requests for SAML apps
