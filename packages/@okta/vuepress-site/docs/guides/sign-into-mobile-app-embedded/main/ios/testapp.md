1. Build and run your app in Simulator or on a device.
1. Tap **Sign In** at the top of the screen and then tap **Continue** in the permission request alert that appears.

The Okta sign-in browser opens over the app. After the user successfully signs in, the browser closes and the app displays two rows of buttons:

* A sign out button at the top
* Several buttons that show user info, the token, and to refresh the token (used to [keep the user signed in](#keep-the-user-signed-in))
